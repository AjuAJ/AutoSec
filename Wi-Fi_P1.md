# Mission Brief

Agent, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is as follows:  
A G-Wagon has been equipped with a secure Wi-Fi network that only its owner has access to. The vehicle's owner, a high-profile individual, is currently attending a global summit, and our intelligence indicates the vehicle holds critical information that could trigger a nuclear crisis. We've secured you access to the summit, positioned near the high-profile individual.
 

### **Your Objective**: 
Deceive the individual's phone into revealing the Wi-Fi credentials. Once you’ve acquired them, connect to the G-Wagon’s secure network and uncover the critical information stored within.

Failure is not an option, Agent. The success of this mission lies in your hands. Good luck, and remember,time is critical.

This mission will test your skills in Wi-Fi exploitation and network enumeration.
