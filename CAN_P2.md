# **Your Objective**: 
The primary goal of the challenge is to unlock a control unit, retrieve a stored cryptographic key, and demonstrate mastery of secure communication protocols.

### Libs to be installed in ardunio 
- CAN by Sandeep Mistry
- Crypto by Rhys Weatherley

### Challenge Breakdown

1. **Initial Lock State**
   - The control unit starts in a locked state.
   - Access to the control unit is restricted by a cryptographic mechanism.

2. **Seed and Response Mechanism**
   - The control unit issues a seed, which serves as a cryptographic challenge. The seed is a random number or string generated by the control unit.
   - The ECU will share the 2 byte seed

3. **Cryptographic Handshake**
   - Compare the first 4 bytes of the hash calculates using SHA256 of the 2 byte random seed.
   - If the computed response matches the control unitâ€™s expectation, the control unit transitions to an unlocked state.

4. **Retrieving the Stored Key**
   - Read the key using the correct READ Data By Identifier. 
   - The Key DID: 0x01 0x23
   - Using UDS commands, your goal is to retrieve the stored key from the control unit.
