# Mission Brief

Agent, this is your mission, should you choose to accept it:

Now it's time to take control of their vehicle’s systems. The instrument cluster and Engine ECU communicate through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a seemingly harmless connection. But the instrument cluster holds the power to control the engine: turning it ON or OFF.

You’ve been provided with a file containing intercepted Bluetooth traffic between these two systems. This is your gateway to taking control of the vehicle and ensuring the mission’s success.

## **Your Objective**:
- Analyze the intercepted data.
- Identify the specific commands used to control the engine.
- Learn how to issue those commands yourself.

Once you’re connected, take control of the G-Wagon’s engine.

Time is critical, Agent. You must act swiftly and without leaving a trace.

Bonus Mission: Think you're the best? Your challenge doesn’t end with the engine. Reset the odometer and cover your tracks. Leave no trace of your infiltration.
