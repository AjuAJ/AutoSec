# Mission Brief

Agent, this is your mission, should you choose to accept it:

Now it's time to take control of their vehicle’s systems. The instrument cluster and Engine ECU communicate through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a seemingly harmless connection. But the instrument cluster holds the power to control the engine: turning it ON or OFF.

You’ve been provided with the codes to Turn ON the Engine once you have access to it. This is your gateway to taking control of the vehicle and ensuring the mission’s success.

## **Your Objective**:
- Understand how BLE technology works.
- Identify the specific commands used to control the engine.
- Learn how to issue those commands yourself.

Once you’re connected, take control of the G-Wagon’s engine.

Time is critical, Agent. You must act swiftly and without leaving a trace.

Bonus Mission: Think you're the best? Your challenge doesn’t end with the engine. Reset the odometer and cover your tracks. Leave no trace of your infiltration.
