# The Matrix Hackathon: Red Pill vs Blue Pill

Welcome, Agent! You're at a crossroads. You must choose your path carefully, as each leads to a different world of hacking challenges. 

Do you want to take the **Red Pill** and dive into the deep, secure world of **CAN bus systems** and automotive network hacking? Or will you take the **Blue Pill** and explore the world of **Wi-Fi** and **Bluetooth** vulnerabilities in modern car systems?

---
## ðŸ¤– **Choose Your Path:**

### ðŸŒ¹ **Red Pill: CAN Bus Hacking (Automotive Systems)**

By choosing the **Red Pill**, you will enter the world of **automotive systems** and **Controller Area Network (CAN)**, where you'll manipulate critical car systems to gain control of the vehicle. These challenges are complex and require an understanding of CAN topology, basic embedded systems (Arduino), UDS (Unified Diagnostics Services) and of course security.

#### **Challenges:**

1. **Problem 1: Hack the CAN Bus**
   - Your mission is to infiltrate a vehicle's **CAN bus** and gain control over its electronic components, like the engine or door locking systems. The network is locked behind security measures, but with the right skills, you can manipulate the systems to your advantage.
   - Tools Required: **CAN bus sniffer**, **OBD-II adapter**, **Reverse-engineering tools**

2. **Problem 2: Bypass the Vehicle Security**
   - In this challenge, you'll focus on the security protocols built into the vehicleâ€™s internal network. The goal is to **bypass the security system**, potentially disabling alarms, unlocking doors, or even starting the engine remotely.
   - Tools Required: **CAN protocol analyzer**, **Security bypass tools**

### ðŸ”µ **Blue Pill: Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Hacking (Wireless Communication)**

The **Blue Pill** represents the world of **modern connectivity**. You'll focus on breaking into **Wi-Fi** and **Bluetooth** systems, where vehicles communicate wirelessly with phones, sensors, and other devices. Hack into these systems and you could gain control of the vehicle's critical functions.

#### **Challenges:**

1. **Problem 1: Extract Wi-Fi Credentials**
   - Your task is to gain access to the **vehicle's secure Wi-Fi network**. Using  wireless sniffing techniques, you'll extract the credentials, allowing you to connect to the vehicleâ€™s network and retrieve critical information.
   - Tools Required: **Wireshark**, **nmap**, **Linux Machine**

2. **Problem 2: Hijack Bluetooth Communication**
   - In this challenge, you'll be tasked with **hijacking Bluetooth communication** between the vehicle and an authorized device (like the carâ€™s mobile app). Once inside, you can control functions such as the engine start/stop or even manipulate the car's dashboard displays.
   - Tools Required: **Bluetooth scanner**, **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) tools**, **Bluetooth protocol analyzer**

### ðŸ“¢ **Rules and Guidelines**

1. **Tools**: You will be given access to certain tools and hardware (, etc.), depending on the path you choose.
2. **Path**: You have the freedom to switch between paths at any time during the challenge.
3. **Time Limit**: The hackathon will last for **10 hours**. Complete as many challenges as you can in the time provided.
3. **Collaboration**: While the challenges are designed for individual teams, feel free to collaborate and discuss problems with other team members.
4. **Judging**: Submissions will be judged based on **creativity**, **complexity**, and **effectiveness** in solving the challenges.
5. **Safety**: Please ensure that all actions are performed ethically and legally. Avoid damaging any systems or breaching any real-world security without authorization.
