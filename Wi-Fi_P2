# Mission Brief

Agent, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is as follows:

The high-profile individual has reactivated the nuclear warhead using an alternate, highly secure mechanism. This device is located at a different site, and you must travel to the location to disable it. But first, there's a critical obstacle in your path: the G-Wagon’s security systems. The vehicle has been outfitted with cutting-edge security measures, all designed to prevent unauthorized access. The high-profile individual is on their way to retrieve something from the car, and in doing so, will briefly disable and then reactivate the security systems. **This is your opportunity to strike!**

### **Your Objective**:
Monitor the communications between the individual's phone and the G-Wagon, and identify the vulnerabilities that will allow you to disable the vehicle’s defenses. 

#### <u>Bonus Mission</u>:  
The system also holds a file with the names of all the double agents within our agency. Retrieve it, and you will be rewarded.

This mission will test your skills in network enumeration, network traffic analysis, and exploiting security flaws in unencrypted web communication.
